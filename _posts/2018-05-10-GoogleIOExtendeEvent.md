When I saw the message on Slack that I have a chance to attend Google I/O 2018, I almost jumped out of my chair. Though there were thousands of others who also got the same message, it didn't stop me from feeling excited. Before you set any kind of expectations, let me break the news - no, it wasn't me who got that opportunity. And that was why I attended one of the many Google I/O extended events that happened across the world in many countries. If you are not aware, Google I/O is the annual tech festival that happens every year. Developers and tech enthusiasts from around the world, attend the event and take part in tech talks, codelabs, discussions and many more events. Google also announces its exciting products and new features during this event. Google I/O extended events are organized by Google Developer Groups or local tech groups across the world where people gather, watch live stream, have some discussions, fun activities and swags. There were few extended events that were planned and happened in Bangalore and I attended one.
