When I saw the message on Slack that I have a chance to attend Google I/O 2018, I almost jumped out of my chair. Though there were thousands of others who also got the same message, it didn't stop me from feeling excited. Before you set any kind of expectations, let me break the news - no, it wasn't me who got that opportunity. And that was why I attended one of the many Google I/O extended events that happened across the world in many countries. If you are not aware, Google I/O is the annual tech festival that happens every year. Developers and tech enthusiasts from around the world, attend the event and take part in tech talks, codelabs, discussions and many more events. Google also announces its exciting products and new features during this event. Google I/O extended events are organized by Google Developer Groups or local tech groups across the world where people gather, watch live stream, have some discussions, fun activities and swags. There were few extended events that were planned and happened in Bangalore and I attended one.  

We were all waiting for the keynote to start and we had to wait for more than an hour until that happened. Meanwhile, the organizers conducted a quiz by asking questions. There were some swags for those who gave the correct answers. When Sundar Pichai finally took the stage, there were cheers and claps both at the actual I/O venue and at the extended event. "Good morning", he wished everyone in his calm and relaxed voice. Can you guess with what he started his keynote? A major bug! Now if you haven't watched the keynote and wondering why the CEO of Google would do that on such a stage, revealing to the world a major bug in one of its products, what he was really talking about was the burger emoji controversy. Can't get a better start to the event than this, can we?
