The last time I blogged which was a few days ago, I told myself that the next time I do it, it should be something other than writing about my experience in some tech event. Looks like I should postpone that for another time. Because here I am, writing again about yet another tech conference. This time there is one difference though. I am writing this as I am still in the summit. What summit? I am talking about the Great Indian Developer Summit 2018, that is happening right now in Bangalore. And without any delay, let me straight away take you through what all happened so far. 

The event started at 8.30 in the morning. All the delegates and the speakers gathered in the Main Hall for the keynote sessions. They say first impressions matter a lot. If it’s really true, then Michael Carducci made sure that he made the best first impression. He delivered first of the keynote talks and the hundreds of people in the hall got glued to his presentation. With two decades of experience in programming, he talked about good and bad ways of development and programming through his experience and stories. He gave an enthralling, entertaining and a rockstar presentation and made us clap and laugh throughout his talk.

Guru Bhatt from PayPal came next and he didn’t hesitate to announce to the audience how tough it is to continue when the speaker who talked before was Michael. His talk was about using AI to solve realtime problems. If you own a banking system, one of the crucial things you want to handle without fail is fraud detection. He gave an example of one specific use case — seller and buyer colluding which causes the baking system to lose. This can be detected using Collaborative Filtering and Deep Learning. Use cases like these prove that AI is not a mere hype. Having said all that, he concluded by saying, “Not every nail needs the AI hammer”.

There were few more talks during the keynote. Andy Younis who is the founder of Rocket Software company said, “What we do at Rocket is innovate. 28 years ago I wanted to start a company in which I would love to work.” His talk was about how culture plays a very important role in how a company can evolve and innovate. Girish Dhanakshirur talked about serverless architecture, IBM patterns which I got a chance to check from IBM booth. IBM patterns contain ready made code which can be used to solve a problem. For example, I saw the demo of using IBM Patterns for analyzing traffic. If you are familiar with Google Codelab, I found this similar. Harshad Oak ended the keynote session by talking about how it’s important for the startups to have the network and mentorship besides their brilliant ideas and talent. Whether it’s Oracle or any other organisation that now has startup mentorship programs, he urged that it is very important and necessary for startups to be involved in such programs.

By the time we came out of the keynote, all the expo showcase booths are setup and ready. There were booths from Google, WalmartLabs, PayPal, Amazon Alexa, Sapient, Sabre,Goldman Sachs and many others. People looked excited as they went from one booth to another, participated in quizs and contests, kept filling their empty bag with goodies. This was the best part of the summit, not just because they were giving away gifts. We could directly talk to representatives from all those organisations, get to know about what kind of interesting things they are doing and their current career options. There are some sessions which are going on. The ones that I wanted to attend on Machine Learning are sadly cancelled. I will be attending another session soon, so I am actually in a rush to finish this blog.

The above is one of my favourite demos here at the event. It’s a personalizing mirror. It predicts the gender of the person standing in front of it, detects and classifies the clothes of the person and then gives some clothes recommendations to try out. For this, they make use of Deep Learning model with 50 layers. It’s interesting to know that the team that’s working on it is currently in Bangalore! So if you are a Machine Learning enthusiast, you should check Sapient’s career page right now! 

I have a session to attend now. Will update the blog for more(this includes the goodies I filled in my bag!)
