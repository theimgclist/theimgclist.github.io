“How was the month of March for you?” In the second week of it, I was at Microsoft office to attend Data Platform Day, a full day event organised by DataPlatformGeeks. There were more than 200 people who attended it and it had some good sessions. Especially the first one in which Sandeep who currently works at Microsoft shared his story and journey so far of being an aspiring Data Scientist. The week before that I was at Uber Tech Talk which took us into the details of how Uber works and leverages Machine Learning and Analytics. In the last week of March, I attended Cloud Community program and also Women Techmakers Summit, both events organised by Google. If I have to answer the question myself then I would say, “March has been a month of meetups”. Continuing the same in April, I attended an other meetup today. This one was organised by Machine Learning and AI Foundation. If you read the title of this story, then you must be wondering how this one was different. Hold on, you will get to know it soon.
