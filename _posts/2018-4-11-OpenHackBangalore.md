When I thought of writing my next post on this meetup, I asked myself,"When will I start writing about anything other than the events I go to?" Though I did write few blogs which are not about any meetups or events, most of the blogs so far have been about the sessions/talks I attended. One of the reasons that compels me to write about such events is the amount and variety of new information and knowledge I get by attending a meetup/session that lasts for a couple of hours. These are insights, advices, tips and words spoken and shared from experiences which we don't often find from courses or text books. OpenHack's open community meetup that I got a chance to attend was nothing short of such an event that gave every single attendee many useful insights.
